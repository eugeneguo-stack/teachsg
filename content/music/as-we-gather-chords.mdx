Verse:
D     F#m 
As we gather  
         G              A 
May Your Spirit work within us 
D     F#m           G            A 
As we gather may we glorify Your Name
G       A                F#m             Bm
Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship
Em       A                  D-D7 
We'll be blessed because we came 
Em       A                  D 
We'll be blessed because we came
