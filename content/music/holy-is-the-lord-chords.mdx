Verse:
G            C           D
We stand and lift up our hands
        Em         C           D
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
G               C           D
We bow down and worship Him now
    Em        C          D
How great how awesome is He
                A-C
And together we sing

Chorus:
            G    C     D
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
    Em       C               D
The earth is filled with His glory (x2)
    Em       C               D
The earth is filled with His glory 

Bridge:
     G         D  
It's rising up all around
         F             C
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown (x2)
                A-C
And together we sing 
         A-C-D
Everyone sing
