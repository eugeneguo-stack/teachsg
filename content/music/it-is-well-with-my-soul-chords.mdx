Verse 1:
     C             F        Dm G       C    
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
     Am           Dm          G-G7
When sorrows like sea billows roll
    C       F              Dm           G
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
      C           F    G       C
It is well, it is well with my soul

Chorus:
      C           G      
It is well (it is well)
                      C
With my soul (with my soul)
      F           G            C
It is well, it is well with my soul

Verse 2:
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

Verse 3:
My sinÃ¢â‚¬â€oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul

Verse 4:
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live
If Jordan above me shall roll
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul

Verse 5:
But, Lord, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait
The sky, not the grave, is our goal
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul

Verse 6:
And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul
