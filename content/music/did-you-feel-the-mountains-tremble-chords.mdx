Did you feel the mountains tremble

Jesus Christ the risen One 

Verse 2:
Did you feel the people tremble 
Did you hear the singers roar
When the lost began to sing of 
Jesus Christ the saving One

Pre-chorus:
           Eb/G                Bb
And we can see that God You're moving
         Eb/G              Bb
A mighty river through the nations 
              Eb/G             Bb
And young and old will turn to Jesus

Fling wide you heavenly gates

Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Let the streets resound with singing 
Bb              
Songs that bring Your hope

Songs that bring Your joy
Eb/C        F            Bb
Dancers who dance upon injustice 

Verse 3:
Do you feel the darkness tremble
When all the saints join in one song
And all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness
