Verse 1: 
D              A 
When the music fades      
                 Em 
All is stripped away   
             A 
And I simply come 
D               A 
Longing just to bring   
                    Em 
Something that's of worth  
                     A  
That will bless Your heart 
 
Pre-chorus: 
Em             D/F#        A         
I'll bring You more than a song          
               Em 
For a song in itself      
            D/F#       A 
Is not what You have required 
Em              D/F#     A 
You search much deeper within     
                        Em 
Through the way things appear      
               D/F#    A 
You're looking into my heart 
 
Chorus: 
D                      A 
I'm coming back to the heart of worship          
         Em 
And it's all about You    
     G         A         
It's all about You, Jesus   
D                      A 
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it 
          Em       
When it's all about You   
     G         A      D 
It's all about You, Jesus 

Verse 2: 
King of endless worth 
No one could express 
How much You deserve 

Though I'm weak and poor 
All I have is Yours 
Every single breath
