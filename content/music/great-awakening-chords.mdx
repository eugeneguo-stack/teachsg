Lord, pour out Your Spirit

On all the people of the earth

Speak Your words of prophesy

Reveal the secrets of Your heart

Let all heaven sound the coming of Your day

ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be a great revival in our land

They will be saved

Lord, pour out Your Spirit
On all the nations of the world

Let them fall in reverent awe

Show Your mighty power
Shake the heavens and the earth
Lord the world is waiting
Let creation see the coming of Your day
