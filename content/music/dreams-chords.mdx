Verse 1:
D             G
There comes a time
     A                D
When everything comes down
               G
To what it may be
    A               Bm
The meaning of true life
          G  
Is it the path I take
   A              Bm
To realise all my dreams
              G
What can they be
                A
And who will be with me

Verse 2:
Many a time
I tried to seek the truth
To what it may be
The meaning of true life

I finally found the truth
And know that all my dreams
Must be in Him
Must be in Him

Chorus:
        G        A                 D-D7
In Your time, my dreams will be fulfilled
        G        A              D-D7
In Your love, my life will be renewed
      G           A       Bm  A  G
All I want, is to give my all to You
        C                           A
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be still and know that You are Lord
        C                           A
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be still and know that You are Lord
D
Of my life
