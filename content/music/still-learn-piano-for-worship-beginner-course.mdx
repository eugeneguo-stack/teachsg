Verse 1:
C       Am  
Hide me now
  F        G
Under Your wings   
C     Am
Cover me
  F                G  
Within Your mighty hand   
  
Chorus:
                F        G        C  
When the oceans rise and thunders roar   
                 F     G        Am  
I will soar with You, above the storm   
                F     G       C
Father, You are King over the flood     
          F              G       C
And I will be still, know You are God
