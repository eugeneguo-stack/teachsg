Verse 1:
D            A/C#
Light of the world
            Em
You stepped down into darkness
D         A/C#         G
Opened my eyes, let me see
D           A/C#      Em
Beauty that made this heart adore You
D         A/C#            G
Hope of a life spent with You

Chorus:
                 D
So, here I am to worship
             A/C#
Here I am to bow down
             Bm                 G
Here I am to say that You're my God
                  D               
You're altogether lovely
           A/C#
Altogether worthy
           Bm           G
Altogether wonderful to me

Verse 2:
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the Earth You created
All for love's sake become poor

Bridge:
         A     D        G
And I'll never know how much it cost
    A     D    G      
To see my sin upon that cross (x2)
