Verse:
E           E2
My Saviour, redeemer
E                  E2
Lifted me from the miry clay
E         E2
Almighty, forever
E                   E2 
I will never be the same

Pre-chorus:
                C#m
'Cause You came near
             A
From the everlasting
                E
To the world we live
                  B
The Father's only Son

Chorus:
    E              B/D#
You lived, and You died
    C#m           B
You rose again on high
       E          B/D#
You've opened the way
        C#m            B
For the world to live again
     A    B                E
Hallelujah, for all You've done
