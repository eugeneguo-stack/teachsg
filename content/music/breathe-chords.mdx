Verse:
G           C        
This is the air I breathe
G           C
This is the air I breathe
Em   Em/D C        Am        D
Your holy presence living in me
G          C        
This is my daily bread
G          C        
This is my daily bread
Em   Em/D C    Am        D
Your very Word spoken to me

And I'm lost without You
