Verse 1:
E F#m    G#m-A
I have a Maker  
E  A         B 
He formed my heart 
E      F#m  G#m    A 
Before even time began
E           B      E 
My life was in His hands  

Chorus:
A  E        B-E 
He knows my name  
A  E        B     E 
He knows my every thought 
A  E         B         C#m 
He sees each tear that falls             
    A        B      E 
And hears me when I call  

Verse 2: 
I have a Father

He'll never leave me 
No matter where I go
