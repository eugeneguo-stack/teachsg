Chorus:
       D            Bm
God is good all the time
          G                     A
He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine
       D            Bm
God is good all the time
            G                 A          
Through the darkest night His light will shine
       G            A            D
God is good, God is good all the time

Verse 1:
          A                   Bm
If you're walking through the valley
              G            Bm-A
And there are shadows all around
       F#m           Bm
Do not fear, He will guide you
        G                 A
He will keep you safe and sound
           Em                A
For He has promised to never leave you
       Em
Nor forsake you
        G       A        
And His Word is true

Verse 2:
We were sinners, so unworthy
And still for us He choose to die
Filled us with His Holy Spirit
Now we can testify
That His love is everlasting
And His mercies, they will never end

Bridge:
         Bm           F#m
Though I may not understand
        C                  G
All the plans You have for me
   Bb	           F
My life is in Your hands
                A
And through the eyes of faith
      G       A
I can clearly see
