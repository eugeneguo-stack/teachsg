Verse:
D                        G   D
Come, now is the time to worship
A                        Em        G 
Come, now is the time to give your heart
D                        G   D
Come, just as you are to worship 
A                       Em        G 
Come, just as you are before your God
D 
Come  

Chorus:
G                            D        	 
One day every tongue will confess You are God 
G                       D
One day every knee will bow 
G                             Bm
Still the greatest treasure remains for those            
Em                    A
Who gladly choose You now
