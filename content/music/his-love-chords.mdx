Verse 1: 
C                   F  
Once I thought that love was meant for  
G               C 
Anyone else but me 
                    F               G-G7
Once I thought that no one knew the way 
C                     F       
Now that only goes to show     
             G       C  
How wrong we all can be 
       F               G                  C 
Ã¢â‚¬ËœCause now it seems He loves me more each day   

Chorus:
C7          F               G
His love is warmer than the warmest sunshine 
Em            Am 
Softer than a sigh 
            Dm              G
His love is deeper than the deepest ocean 
C              C7 
Wider than the sky 
            F                 G
His love is brighter than the brightest star 
     Em                  Am 
That shines every night above 
             Dm              G 
And there is nothing in this world that can 
     F      G   C 
Ever change His love  
 
Verse 2:
Something happened to my heart  
The day that I met Him 
Something that I never felt before
 
And that something is that  
He has buried all my sins 
And everyday I know He loves me more
