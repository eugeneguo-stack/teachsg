Verse 1:    
    D/F#-G-A (E/G#-A-B)
You dance over me  
     D/F#-G-A (E/G#-A-B)
While I am unaware  
    D/F#-G-A (E/G#-A-B)
You sing all around   
      D/F#-G-A (E/G#-A-B)
But I never hear the sound  

Chorus:  
           G-A (A-B)
Lord, I'm amazed by You  
           D/F#-G (E/G#-A)  
Lord, I'm amazed by You  
           Em-A (F#m-B)
Lord, I'm amazed by You  
        D (E) 
How You love me  

Bridge:  
    G-A (A-B)
How deep  
    D/F#-G (E/G#-A)  
How wide  
    Em-A (F#m-B)
How great  
                 D (E)  
Is your love for me  

Verse 2:
You paint the morning sky
With miracles in mind
My hope will always stand
For You hold me in Your hand
