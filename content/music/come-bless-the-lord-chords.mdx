Chorus:
A              D                          A
Come bless the Lord, O ye servants of the Lord
              Em-A                       D-A  
Who stands by night, in the house of the Lord
             D                  G
Lift up your hands, in the holy place
              D-A                 D
And bless the Lord, and bless the Lord
