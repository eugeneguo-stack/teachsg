<pre>Verse 1: 
D      A/C#         Bm      D/A 
As the deer panteth for the water               
      G            A     D-A
So my soul longeth after Thee 
D    A/C#        Bm       D/A 
You alone are my heart's desire              
      G       A       D
And I long to worship You  

Chorus: 
Bm    D/A        G            D/F#m 
You alone are my strength, my shield      
   Em               G      F#          
To You alone may my spirit yield 
D    A/C#        Bm       D/A 
You alone are my heart's desire              
      G       A       D
And I long to worship You  

Verse 2: 
You're my friend and You are my brother 
Even though You are a King 
I love You more than any other 
So much more than anything 

Verse 3: 
I want You more than gold or silver 
Only You can satisfy 
You alone are the real joy giver 
And the apple of my eye
