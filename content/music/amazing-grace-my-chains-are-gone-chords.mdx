Verse 1:
G       G7
Amazing grace
    C         G
How sweet the sound
     Em                  D
That saved a wretch like me
  G        G7        C       G
I once was lost, but now I'm found
    Em         D     G
Was blind, but now I see

Verse 2:
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Chorus:
              C
My chains are gone
              G
I've been set free
           C                    D
My God, my Saviour has ransomed me
           C               G-Em
And like a flood His mercy reigns
         Am  D         G
Unending love, amazing grace

Verse 3:
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

Verse 4:
The earth shall soon 
Dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, who called me here below
Will be forever mine

Closing:
     Em D       C
Will be forever mine
     Em D       G
You are forever mine
