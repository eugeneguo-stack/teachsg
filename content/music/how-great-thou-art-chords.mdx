<pre>Verse 1:
E         A
O Lord my God      
                  D
When I in awesome wonder 
         A          
Consider all         
    E                     A-E 
The worlds Thy hands have made
          A  
I see the stars
                   D       
I hear the rolling thunder
                 A 
Thy power throughout
    E           A-E
The universe displayed

Chorus:
              A        D              A-F#m
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
               Bm-E                A-E 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
              A        D              A-F#m
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
               Bm-E                A        
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Verse 2:
When through the woods
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees

When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook
And feel the gentle breeze

Verse 3:
And when I think
That God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

That on the cross
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
To take away my sin  

Verse 4:
When Christ shall come
With shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God, how great Thou art
