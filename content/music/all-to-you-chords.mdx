Verse 1 :
  F 
I lay my life before You
     C 
Lord I surrender all
Gm 
All that I have been through             
       Dm             C
Lord I give it to You now
    G 
And though I have some questions
            D 
Things I'll never understand
  Am 
I come into Your presence
      Em                 D 
And I place them in Your hands  
Chorus:
Am  D  G    D   Bm Em
All to You, all to You
C         D      G 
I give it all to You
Am  D  G    D   Bm Em
All to You, all to You
C         D      G 
I give it all to You

Verse 2:
I know that You are faithful 
That Your promises are true 
Your mercy will sustain me 
And Your grace will see me through 

So I lift my hands before You 
As a sacrifice of praise 
I cast my cares upon You 
And I come to You in faith
