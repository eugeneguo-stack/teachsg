            G
Come on and celebrate
                          Em
His gift of love, we will celebrate
                   C        Am
The Son of God who loved us

And gave us life

We'll shout Your praise, O King

You gave us joy nothing else can bring
                      C        D
We'll give to You our offering

In celebration praise
