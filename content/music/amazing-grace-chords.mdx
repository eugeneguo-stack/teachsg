 G      G7         C         G       
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
D/F# Em      Am          D
That saved a wretch like me      
  G        G7       C      G
I once was lost but now am found 
D/F# Em        Am  D G-D
Was blind, but now I see

Verse 2:
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace, my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed

Verse 3:
Through many dangers, toils and snares 
I have already come 
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far 
And grace will lead me home

Verse 4:
The Lord has promised good to me 
His Word my hope secures 
He will my shield and portion be 
As long as life endures

Verse 5:
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail 
And mortal life shall cease 
I shall possess within the veil 
A life of joy and peace  

Verse 6:
When we've been here ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we've first begun
