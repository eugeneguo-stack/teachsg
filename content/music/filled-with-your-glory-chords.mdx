Verse 1:  
G               
In my heart, in my heart                
 
There's a fire burning          
D                        Am
A passion deep within my soul
 	                      D 
Not slowing down, not growing cold
     G
An unquenchable flame           
    
That keeps burning brighter
D                              Am 
A love that's blazing like the sun  	  
                                D 
For who You are and what You've done

Pre-chorus 1:
    C      G       D      Em
And as the fire is raging on
   C                      D
So Your praise becomes my song

Chorus:
          G               
The whole earth           
                           D 
Is filled with Your glory, Lord
                Am            
Angels and men adore  
D 
Creation longs for what's in store
        G        
May You be     
                  D 
Honoured and glorified     
                   Am 
Exalted and lifted high
C                    D
Here at Your feet, I lay my life

Verse 2:
From the ends of the earth 
To the heights of heaven
Your glory, Lord, is far and wide 
Through history You reign on high

From the depths of the sea 
To the mountain's summit
Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds 
A higher love cannot be found

Pre-chorus 2:
So let the universe proclaim
Your great power and Your great Name
