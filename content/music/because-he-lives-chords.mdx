<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Verse 1:                        
             G-G7                 C-Am 
God sent His son, they called Him Jesus                   
           G-Em              Am-D 
He came to love, heal and forgive                   
             G-G7           C-Am 
He lived and died to buy my pardon              
         G                 D                G-D 
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives

Chorus:                 
           G-G7                C-Am 
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow               
           G-Em               Am-D 
Because He lives, all fear is gone                 
          G-G7                       C-Am 
Because I know, I know, He holds the future              
            G                 D               G 
And life is worth the living, just because He lives  

Verse 2: 
How sweet to hold a newborn baby 
And feel the pride and joy he gives 
But greater still the calm assurance 
This child can face uncertain days because He lives  

Verse 3: 
And then one day I'll cross the river 
I'll fight life's final war with pain 
And then as death gives way to victory 
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives
