Verse 1: 
F#m 
Oh when He rolls up His sleeves 
He ain't just puttin' on the ritz 
    Bm        C#m     F#m 
Our God is an awesome God 
There is thunder in His footsteps 
And lightning in His fists 
    Bm        C#m     F#m 
Our God is an awesome God
        Bm
And the Lord wasn't joking 
When He kicked 'em out of Eden 
   C#m
It wasn't for no reason 
That He shed His blood 
       D 
His return is very soon 
          D/B          D/F# 
And you'd better be believin' that 
    Bm        C#m     F#m 
Our God is an awesome God  
Chorus:
    D         A 
Our God is an awesome God 
   E           F#m         
He reigns from heaven above 
     D       A     
With wisdom, power and love 
    Bm        C#m     F#m 
Our God is an awesome God  
 
Verse 2: 
And when the sky was starless 
In the void of the night 
Our God is an awesome God  
He spoke into the darkness 
And created the light  
Our God is an awesome God 

And judgement and wrath 
He poured out on Sodom 
Mercy and grace 
He gave us at the cross  
I hope that we have not  
Too quickly forgotten that 
Our God is an awesome God
