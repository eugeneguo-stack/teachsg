Verse 1:
D                  G    A       D
There is a longing only You can fill
F#m      Bm      Em           A
A raging tempest only You can still
Bm
My soul is thirsty Lord
   G               D
To know You as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m known
Em             F#m
Drink from the river
     G                 A
That flows before Your throne

Chorus:
        D
Take me deeper
          Bm
Deeper in love with You
Em            F#m             A
Jesus hold me close in Your embrace
        D
Take me deeper
                 Bm
Deeper than IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever been before
               G                 D
I just want to love You more and more
      Em         A         D
How I long to be deeper in love  

Verse 2:
Sunrise to sunrise I will seek Your face
Drawn by the Spirit to the promise of Your grace
My heart has found in You
A hope that will abide
Here in Your presence
Forever satisfied
