Verse 1:
      D
We're pilgrims on the journey
       G 
Of the narrow road
    D               
And those who've gone before us  
         G 
Line the way
Em              F#m       
Cheering on the faithful       
  Em            F#m  
Encouraging the weary
      Em               F#m            
Their lives a stirring testament 
   G                A 
To God's sustaining grace
   D           
Surrounded by so great 
           G 
A cloud of witnesses
       D    
Let us run the race   
                 G 
Not only for the prize
       Em 
But as those who've  
       F#m 
Gone before us
       Em      
Let us leave  
           F#m 
To those behind us
    Em          F#m           
The heritage of faithfulness 
       G                A 
Passed on through godly lives

Chorus:
       G              A         
Oh may all who come behind us 
        D 
Find us faithful
        G             A          
May the fire of our devotion
            Bm 
Light their way
        G                  A
May the footprints that we leave
F#m            Bm
Lead them to believe
        G  
And the lives we live
  Em             A 
Inspire them to obey
       G              A         
Oh may all who come behind us       
        D 
Find us faithful

Verse 2:
After all our hopes and dreams 
Have come and gone
And our children sift through all 
We've left behind

May the clues that they discover 
And the memories they uncover
Become the light that leads them to 
The road we each must find
