Chorus:
     C/E    F       G
Be enthroned in our worship, oh God (x4)

Verse 1:
  C/E  F      G    
A multitude before You
   C/E        F       G    
As far as any eye can see
   C/E-F       G   Am   
In awe of Your wonder
        C/E-F G
We sing holy, holy
      C/E       F         G    
Every tribe and tongue proclaiming
   C/E      F            G    
Salvation belongs to our God
        C/E     F     G    Am
All the nations bow before You
        C/E-F G
We sing holy, holy
        C/E-F   G
You are worthy, worthy

Bridge:
F                 G          Am
Praise and glory, honour and power
     F            G
It's Yours, it is Yours (x4)
