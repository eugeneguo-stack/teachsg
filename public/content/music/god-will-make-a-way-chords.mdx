Chorus:                 
G (A)           D (E)           
God will make a way          
            C (D)          G (A) 
Where there seems to be no way        
   C (D)            G (A) 
He works in ways we cannot see 
Am (Bm)        D (E) 
He will make a way for me 
G (A)         D (E) 
He will be my guide  
        C (D)          G (A) 
Hold me closely to His side           
     C (D)         
With love and strength       
    G (A) 
For each new day 
Am (Bm)        D (E) 
He will make a way 
C (D)   D (E)  G (A) 
He will make a way  

Verse:          
     Eb             F          
By a roadway in the wilderness         
      Bb  
He'll lead me     
    Eb            F             G 
And rivers in the desert will I see 
C                     D 
Heaven and earth will fade         
        Bm               Em 
But His Word will still remain 
C          D             Em-E 
He will do something new today
