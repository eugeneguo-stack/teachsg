Verse 1:
D  G           A        D
Oh Lord You've searched me
    G       A
You know my ways
D    G       A   Bm
Even when I fail You
G          A
I know You love me
D    G    A   D
Your holy presence
    G       A
Surrounding me
D  G     A  Bm
In every season
G          A
I know You love me
G          A
I know You love me

Chorus:
D                     Bm
At the cross I bow my knee
                              G
Where Your blood was shed for me
                             A
There's no greater love than this
D                     Bm
You have overcome the grave
                             G
Your glory fills the highest place
                     A
What can separate me now

Verse 2:
You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know You love me

And when the earth fades
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
I know You love me

Bridge:
             F#m              Bm                     
You tore the veil, You made a way
         G               A
When You said that it is done
