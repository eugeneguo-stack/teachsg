Verse: 
  D        F#m 
O Lord our God 
    G              D 
How excellent Your Name is 
    Em                             A
How excellent Your Name in all the earth 
     Bm              F#m 
Your glory fills the heaven 
  G                 D 
Beyond the farthest star 
    Em             A               D 
How excellent Your Name in all the earth   

Chorus:
       Bm              F#m 
When I think about the heavens 
    Bm               F#m 
The moon and all the stars 
  G                           D-A
I wonder what You ever saw in me 
        Bm              F#m 
But You took me and You loved me  
           Bm         F#m 
And You've given me a crown 
    E                                A
And now I'll praise Your Name eternally
