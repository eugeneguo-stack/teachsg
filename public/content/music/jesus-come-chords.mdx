Verse: 
C            Em      Am  
You said, if we will build it
F   C/E  Dm-G
You will come
C            Em      Am  
You said, if we will seek Your face
F      C/E Dm-G
YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be found

Pre-Chorus:
      F      
So we build unto You
  Em        Am
A palace of praise
  Dm             G           C-C7
A throne room of worship for You
        F          
In this place we choose   
   Em          Am
To honour Your Name
        Dm       G       Am
In everything we say and do
         Dm    G         C-G
Let Your glory fill this room

Chorus:
      C           Em-Am
Jesus come, Jesus come
F            G             C-C7
Come, we are desperate for You
      F   G       Em-Am
Jesus come, Jesus come
Dm       G         C
Come and fill this room
