Verse 1:
C
My hope is built on nothing less
F                    G
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
Am                   C
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
F          G               C-C7
But wholly trust in Jesus' name

Chorus:
        F     Am    G
Christ alone, cornerstone
          F              Am        G
Weak made strong, in the Saviour's love
            F      Am    G
Through the storm, He is Lord
        C
Lord of all

Verse 2:
When darkness seems to hide his face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil

Verse 3:
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne
