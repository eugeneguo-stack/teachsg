Verse 1:    
A                              D
Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude
   A                 C#m       F#m             
Of those from, every tribe and tongue
            Bm                      D
We are Your people redeemed by Your blood
             Bm             E
Rescued from death, by Your love
             A                    D
There are no words good enough to thank You
             A          C#m      F#m
There are no words to express my praise
           Bm      
But I will lift up my voice
    C#m
And sing from my heart
     D                 E  
With all of my strength

Chorus:
     A          F#m        D
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

To the Lamb
     A          F#m       
Hallelujah hallelujah
       D                  E
By the blood of Christ we stand
      A            F#m
Every tongue every tribe
      D            E 
Every people every land
       A            F#m  
Giving glory giving honour
       D               E       A
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God   

Verse 2:
Lord we stand by grace in Your presence
Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
We are Your children called by Your Name
Humbly we bow and we pray

Release Your power
To work in us and through us
Till we are changed
To be more like You

Then all the nations will see
Your glory revealed
And worship You

Bridge:
F     C/E        G
Every knee shall bow
F     C/E         
Every tongue confess
     G               Bm/E-C#m/E-D/E
That You are Lord of all
