Verse:
E          E/D-C#m
The more I seek You
           A-E
The more I find You
           E/D-C#m
The more I find You
           A-E
The more I love You

Chorus:
                    E/D
I wanna sit at Your feet
                           C#m
Drink from the cup in Your hand
                         A-E
Lay back against You and breathe, feel Your heartbeat
                E/D
This love is so deep
                     C#m
It's more than I can stand
               A-E
I melt in Your peace, it's overwhelming
