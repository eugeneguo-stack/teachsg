Verse 1:
      B               E
If my heart has grown cold
           B           E
There Your love will unfold
       G#m     F#          E            F#
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
         B           E
When I'm blind to my way
           B           E
There Your Spirit will pray
       G#m     F#          E            F#
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
       G#m     F#          E            F#
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand

Chorus:
            B             B/Bb
Oceans will part, nations come
       E          F#   B-F#
At the whisper of Your call
          B           B/Bb
Hope will rise, glory shown
      E         F#      B
In my life Your will be done

Verse 2:
Present suffering may pass
Lord Your mercy will last
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
And my heart will find praise
I'll delight in Your way
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
