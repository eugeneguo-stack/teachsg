Verse 1:
G         C        F        C
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine                   
         Am           Dm      G
O what a foretaste of glory divine                    
           C       F           C-Am
Heir of salvation, purchase of God                      
            Dm      G             C-G
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

Chorus:
           C      F          C-Am
This is my story, this is my song                       
            F        Dm          G
Praising my Saviour, all the day long
           C      F          C-Am
This is my story, this is my song                       
            F-Dm     G           C
Praising my Saviour, all the day long

Verse 2:
Perfect submission, perfect delight 
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight 
Angels descending bring from above 
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

Verse 3:
Perfect submission, all is at rest 
I in my Saviour am happy and blest 
Watching and waiting, looking above 
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love
