Verse:
E           B       C#m
How could I live without You
               A
How could I survive
             B
Without Your love
             G#m 
Without Your touch
                    A 
You're the One that heals me
                E 
And cleanses my heart 
    F#m     B 
And sets me free 

Pre-chorus:
      C#m          A 
Now I come right before You
        E            B 
With my hands lifted up
       C#m          A 
And my heart humbly bowed
        E           B 
At Your work on the cross          
       C#m            A 
As You hung there and died    
         E          B 
You were paying the price
       A            B 
For my life, for my life 
 
Chorus:
         E                       A 
For Your love is higher than the heavens
                C#m 
Deeper than the seas
                  A         B 
And all I want is You in my life
       E                   A 
No one else can satisfy my soul
                      C#m 
Can make me feel this way
     A         B    E 
Only You Lord, only You
