Verse 1:
F               Bb                C
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m forgiven, because You were forsaken
Dm            Bb          C
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m accepted, You were condemned
F                        Bb          C
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
  Bb        C              F-C
Because You died and rose again

Chorus:
F             Bb

Dm                             C
That You my King would die for me
F             Bb
Amazing love, I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true
Dm                    C
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my joy to honour You
F             Bb
Amazing love, how can it be
Dm                             C
That You my King would die for me
F             Bb
Amazing love, I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my joy to honour You

In all I do, I honour You
