Verse 1:          
      Am 
Is it true today 
          F 
That when people pray 
          Am 
Cloudless skies will break 
          F
Kings and queens will shake
          G            F 
Yes, it's true and I believe it
               C-G/B-Am-F 
I'm living for You  

Verse 2: 
Is it true today 
That when people pray 
We'll see dead men rise 
And the blind set free 
Yes, it's true and I believe it 
I'm living for You  

Chorus:
C          C/B         Am            F 
I'm gonna be a history maker in this land 
C          C/B            Am           F 
I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind 
C              G/B-Am      F      
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run 
C             G/B-Am            F 
Into Your arms, into Your arms again  

Verse 3:
Well it's true today that when people stand 
With the fire of God and the truth at hand 
We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing 
We'll see broken hearts, making history 
Yes, it's true and I believe it 
We're living for You
