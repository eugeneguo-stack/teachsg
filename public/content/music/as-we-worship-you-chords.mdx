Verse 1:
      D
As we worship You
            A
Let all the world come and see
        Bm
How the mercy we received from You
    G
Can set them free
      D
As we worship You
             A
Let all this joy that fills our hearts
        Bm
Bring a hunger and a hope 
                G
To those whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve strayed so far

Chorus:
      Em        A
As we bow in adoration
    F#m               Bm
And stand in reverent awe
          G
Show Your majesty and glory
         D         A
Let Your anointing fall
        Em                   A
As we declare Your Name Lord Jesus
       F#m           Bm
As the only Name who saves
        Em         
May the power of Your salvation
G                  A-Bm-A
Fill each heart we pray

Verse 2:
As we worship You
Let all the nations hear our song
The song of Jesus and His blood
That proved His love for all

As we worship You
May all the lost and broken come
May they hear Your still small voice
Call out their names each one
