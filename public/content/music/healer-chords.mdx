    G 
You hold my every moment        
    Em 
You calm my raging seas       
    C  
You walk with me through fire         
    Am            D 
And heal all my disease 
  C 
I trust in You   
  Am       D 
I trust in You  

Chorus: 
G              
I believe YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re my healer 
Em                      C 
I believe You are all I need 
G 
I believe YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re my portion 
Em               C 
I believe YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more than enough for me 
Am                  C-D 
Jesus, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all I need

Em 
Nothing is impossible

Nothing is impossible for You      
Am          D 
You hold my world in Your hands
