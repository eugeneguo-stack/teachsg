Verse 1: 
C              G/B       C              G/B
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
C                    G/B           Am             D
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
C            G/B     C              G/B
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
C                    G/B              Am              D
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

Chorus:
    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight
G     Am       D
It is where we are
C      G/B           Em   D    C               
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
Am               D
That we got this far
    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight
G        Am      D
How it's laid to rest
C     G/B           Em    D   C               
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Am          D    G
Believe the very best

Verse 2:
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
