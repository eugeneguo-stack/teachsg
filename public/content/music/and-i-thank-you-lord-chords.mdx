Verse 1:
G7               C-D
And I thank You, Lord                                   
                    Bm      Em
For the trials that come my way                          
                  Am        D
In that way I can grow each day                
             G-G7
As I let You lead                     
                 C-D
And I thank You, Lord                           
                       Bm     Em
For the patience those trials bring                    
                   Am-D
In that process of growing                 
               G-G7
I can learn to care  

Chorus:
             C                D
But it goes against the way I am                
          Bm           Em
To put my human nature down              
            Am             D             G-G7
And let the Spirit take control of all I do                       
                  C       
'Cause when those trials come               
   D            Bm                  Em     
My human nature shouts the thing to do               
               Am               D        G
And God's soft prompting can be easily ignored 
 
Verse 2:
And I thank You, Lord 
With each trial I feel inside 
That You're there to help lead and guide 
Me away from wrong 

'Cause you promised, Lord 
That with every testing 
That your way of escaping is 
Easier to bear 

Verse 3: 
And I thank You, Lord 
For the victory that growing brings 
In surrender of everything 
Life is so worthwhile 

And I thank You, Lord 
That when everything's put in place 
Out in front I can see Your face 
And it's there You belong
