<pre>Verse:
Am        D
Here I am waiting
 G            C-G/B
Abide in me I pray
Am        D
Here I am longing
    G-G7
For You
Am         D
Hide me in Your love
G              C-G/B
Bring me to my knees
Am         D
May I know Jesus
         G
More and more

Chorus:
G            C
Come live in me
       Am         D
All my life, take over
G               C
Come breathe in me
           Am
And I will rise
   C  D    G
On eagles' wings
