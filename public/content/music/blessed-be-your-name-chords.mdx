Verse 1:
G       D       
Blessed be Your Name
       Em           C
In the land that is plentiful 
           G           D
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Em              C
Blessed be Your Name
G       D       
Blessed be Your Name
         Em           C
When I'm found in the desert place
         G                D
Though I walk through the wilderness
Em              C
Blessed be Your Name

Pre-chorus:
G              D
Every blessing You pour out 
     Em           C
I'll turn back to praise
G                 D
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Em           C
Still I will say

Chorus:
               G (A)       D (E)

Blessed be Your glorious Name

Verse 2:
Blessed be Your Name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's 'all as it should be'
Blessed be Your Name

Blessed be Your Name
On the road marked with suffering 
Though there's pain in the offering 
Blessed be Your Name

Bridge:
    G             D
You give and take away
    Em            C
You give and take away
   G                    D
My heart will choose to say
      Em              C
Lord, blessed be Your Name
    G             D
You give and take away
    Em            C
You give and take away
   G                    D
My heart will choose to say
      Em              C (E)
Lord, blessed be Your Name
