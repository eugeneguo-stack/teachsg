<pre>Verse 1: 
    G                      Em
The splendour of the King, clothed in majesty
                    C2                     D
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
   G                           Em
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
                    C2                     D
And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice

Chorus:
    G                 D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me
    Em                D/F# 
How great is our God, all will see
    C          D            G
How great, how great is our God

Verse 2:
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb

Bridge:
G            
Name above all names
D/F#    Em
You are worthy of all praise
   C
My heart will sing
    D            G
How great is our God
