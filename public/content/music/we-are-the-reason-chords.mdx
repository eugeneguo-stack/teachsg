Verse 1:
          G             
As little children 
         Am/F#    B         Em
We would dream of Christmas morn
    Dm      G         C           
And all the gifts and toys        
   G/B       Am 
We knew we'd find
       B          Em             
But we never realised       
       Em/D             Em/C 
A baby born one blessed night
            Am                   D
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives

Chorus 1:
G           
We were the reason      
        Am 
That He gave His life
D                  
We were the reason   
        G 
That He suffered and died
D/F# Em          
To a world that was lost
        Am
He gave all He could give
   C           D         G
To show us the reason to live

Verse 2:
As the years went by 
We learnt more about gifts
The giving of ourselves 
And what that means

On a dark and cloudy day  
A man hung crying in the rain
Because of love, because of love

Bridge:
     Eb                         Bb 
I've finally found a reason for living
        Bbm                     G#
It's in giving every part of my heart to Him
   G#m                  Eb          Cm
In all that I do, every word that I say
        F                      Bb       E
I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him 

Chorus 2:
A                      Bm
We are the reason that He gave His life
E                         A
We are the reason that He suffered and died
E/G#m F#m                         Bm
To a world that was lost, He gave all He could give
   D           E         A
To show us the reason to live 

Ending:
D         E         A 
He is our reason to live
