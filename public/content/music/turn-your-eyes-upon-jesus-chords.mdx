Verse 1:
  C            Em        F   Dm
O soul are you weary and troubled
   F            G            C-G
No light in the darkness you see
        C           C7          F Dm
There's light for a look at the Saviour
    F          G           C-G
And life more abundant and free 

Chorus:
C (D)     G/B (A/C#) Am-Am/G (Bm-Bm/A)
Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
     F (G)       Dm (Em)   G (A)
Look full in His wonderful face
        C (D)     C7 (D7)         F-Fm (G-Gm)
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim 
       C (D)        G (A)     C (D)
In the light of His glory and grace

Verse 2:
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there 
Over us sin no more hath dominion 
For more than conquerors, we are 

Verse 3:
His Word shall not fail you, He promised 
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell
