Verse 1: 
D7        G            A
O let the Son of God enfold you
         F#m            Bm 
With His Spirit and His love
        Em               
Let Him fill your heart
    A            D-D7
And satisfy your soul
          G                    A 
O let Him have the things that hold you
        F#m           Bm 
And His Spirit like a dove              
        Em             A 
Will descend upon your life          
             D-D7
And make you whole 

Chorus:
G A      F#m-Bm 
Jesus, O Jesus 
Em       A         D-D7 
Come and fill Your lambs 
G A      F#m-Bm 
Jesus, O Jesus 
Em       A         D 
Come and fill Your lambs 

Verse 2: 
O come and sing this song with gladness  
As your hearts are filled with joy 
Lift your hands
In sweet surrender to His Name 

O give Him all your tears and sadness 
Give Him all your years of pain 
And you'll enter into life
In Jesus' Name
