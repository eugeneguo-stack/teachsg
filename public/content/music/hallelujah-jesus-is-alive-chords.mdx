Chorus:
     C
Hallelujah  
G
Jesus is alive
Gm
Death has lost its victory
        A        
And the grave has been denied
Dm
Jesus lives forever
Em    F
He's alive
Dm   Em-F-G
He's alive

Verse:
         C
He's the Alpha and Omega
    G
The first and the last is He
    Gm 
The curse of sin is broken
            A  
And we have perfect liberty
    Dm
The Lamb of God has risen
Em    F
He's alive
Dm   Em-F-G
He's alive
     F
Hallelujah
G         C
Jesus is alive
