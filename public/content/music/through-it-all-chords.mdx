You are forever in my life

You see me through the season
G     D            Em
Cover me with Your hands
    C               D 
And lead me in Your righteousness

And I look to You
    Bm        C-D
And I wait on You

Chorus:
     G                   C
I'll sing to You, Lord a hymn of love

For Your faithfulness to me
    G              C  
I'm carried in everlasting arms

You'll never let me go

Through it all
