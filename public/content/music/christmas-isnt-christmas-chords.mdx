Chorus:
C               G/B
Christmas isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Christmas 
        Gm/Bb           A
Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil it happens in your heart
Dm                F/C#
Somewhere, deep inside you
         F/C              G
Is where Christmas really starts
   C                  G/B
So give your heart to Jesus
          F/A            D/F#
YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover when you do
          C
That itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Christmas
       F       G     C-G
Really Christmas for you

Verse:
C            Dm            Em     Dm
Jesus brings warmth like a winter fire
  C            G        C
A light like a candleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glow
             Dm     Em     F
HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s waiting now to come inside
      G      D     G
As He did so long ago
F            G        Em        Am
Jesus brings gifts of truth and life
    Dm         G         C-C7
And makes them bloom and grow
   F       G          Am      F
So welcome Him with a song of joy
    Dm      D            G-G7
And when He comes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know
