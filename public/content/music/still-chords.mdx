Verse 1:
C    G/B Am  
Hide me now
  F   Dm   G
Under Your wings   
C G/B Am
Cover me
  Dm               G  
Within Your mighty hand   
  
Chorus:
                F        G        C  
When the oceans rise and thunders roar   
                 F     G        Am  
I will soar with You, above the storm   
                F     G       C
Father, You are King over the flood     
          Dm        G            Am
And I will be still, know You are God   
          Dm        G            C
And I will be still, know You are God   

Verse 2:
Find rest my soul   
In Christ alone   
Know His power   
In quietness and trust
