Verse:
G 
We bow our hearts 
D/F#
We bend our knees 
C                      G-D
Oh Spirit come make us humble 
G
We turn our eyes 
D/F#
From evil things  
C
Oh Lord we cast down our idols 

Chorus:
                 G 
So give us clean hands  
                 D/F#
And give us pure hearts  
       Em           D         C
Let us not lift our souls to another (x2)
   D          G
Oh God let us be           
                  D/F#
A generation that seeks     
               Em       D      C  
Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob (x2)
