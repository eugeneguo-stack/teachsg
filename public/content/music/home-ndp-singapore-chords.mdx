Verse 1:
         A   
Whenever I am feeling low
        F#m
I look around me and I know
          D                      D/C#
There's a place that will stay within me
        Bm               E
Wherever I may choose to go
       A                 D
I will always recall the city
Bm                    A
Know every street and shore
D                         C#m       F#m
Sail down the river which brings us life
Bm                      E
Winding through my Singapore

Chorus:
        A    A/G#
This is home truly
D              A
Where I know I must be
D                    D/C#
Where my dreams wait for me
          Bm           E
Where the river always flows
        A    A/G#
This is home surely
D            A
As my senses tell me
F#m           E           D
This is where I won't be alone
Bm          E                 A
For this is where I know it's home

Verse 2:
When there are troubles to go through
We'll find a way to start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
That home's about its people too
So we'll build our dreams together
Just like we've done before
Just like the river which brings us life
There'll always be Singapore
